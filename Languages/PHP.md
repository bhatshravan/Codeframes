## About
PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor is a web development framework used in server side pages for dynamic lists and loading of various forms etc.
It is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

A website programmed with PHP can have pages that are password protected. A website with no programming cannot do this without other complex things. Standard PHP file extensions are: .php .php3 or .phtml, but a web server can be set up to use any extension.
Its structure was influenced by many languages like C, Perl, Java, C++, and even Python. It is considered to be free software by the Free Software Foundation.
It can be used by an extension .php 
It can only be run by using a server.
